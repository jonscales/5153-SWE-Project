The error you're seeing is related to Windows PowerShell's execution policy that prevents running scripts (such as npm.ps1) due to security settings. You can fix this by changing the execution policy for PowerShell.

Steps to fix the issue:
Open PowerShell as Administrator:

Press the Windows key, search for "PowerShell", right-click on it, and select Run as Administrator.
Change Execution Policy:

In the PowerShell window, run the following command to allow scripts to be executed:

**Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser**

This allows locally created scripts (like npm.ps1) to run but requires downloaded scripts to be signed by a trusted publisher.
Confirm the Change:

You'll be prompted to confirm the change. Type Y (Yes) and press Enter.
Close the PowerShell Window:

Close the administrator PowerShell window after the policy is set.
Run the React App Again:

Open a new regular PowerShell or Command Prompt window and navigate to your project folder, then try running npm start again:

**npm start**

This should resolve the issue, and your React app should now start without the script execution error. Let me know if it works!


### need to run: **cd hhh-app** ###
