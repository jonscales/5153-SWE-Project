To run the React code (web app) you've shared on VS Code, you'll need to set up your development environment. Hereâ€™s what you need to get started:

1. Install Node.js and npm
First, ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node package manager) installed on your computer, as they are required to run and manage React applications.

Download Node.js (npm comes with Node.js).
After installation, check the versions by running the following commands in your terminal:

**node -v**
**npm -v**

2. Install VS Code Extensions
For a smooth React development experience, install the following extensions in VS Code:

ESLint: Lints your code and ensures you follow the best practices.
Prettier - Code Formatter: Formats your code automatically.
Reactjs code snippets: Provides snippets for faster coding.
JavaScript (ES6) code snippets: Useful for JavaScript development.
Bracket Pair Colorizer: Helps to easily identify matching brackets.
Path Intellisense: Auto-completes file paths.
npm Intellisense: Provides autocomplete for npm modules.
To install these, just go to the Extensions tab in VS Code (on the left sidebar) and search for each one.


5. Start the Development Server
Now that your project is set up, you can run the development server to see the result.

In the terminal, run:

**npm start**

This will start the development server, and you can view the app by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
